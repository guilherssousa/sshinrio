### SSH in Rio

A application to check next events via a BBS-style `ssh` connection. Heavily inspired by `terminal.shop` work.

### How to run

```bash
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
$ sudo python main.py # For some reason, `keyboard` requires root access on Linux
```

### How to deploy

You need to configure your SSH server to run `main.py` every time a user connects to it.

```console
<WIP>
```
